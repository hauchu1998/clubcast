# Clubcast

Here's what our team is working on so far:

**Name**: ClubCast
**Description**: Welcome to ClubCast - a DAO clubhouse where the member have the power to decide the topics members truly care about. Buy a "club fragment", vote on the topic and ensure every session you attend is truly worth your time.
**Github**: https://github.com/hauchu1998/clubcast
**Idea**: undefined
**Blockers**: Actually, I do need help with the issue of uploading some media content to Web.Storage. I wish Filecoin can give me some instructions or direction that how to upload a video larger than 5mb to IPFS with web3.storage node package.

And I prob need Scroll Sepolia network ETH token to access my contract.
